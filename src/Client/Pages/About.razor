<MudText GutterBottom="true" Class="mb-5">
    Valhalla Loot List is a loot system designed to speed up the looting process and reduce
    loot related drama by putting control of loot expectations in the hands of the raiders.
    Rather than a loot council determining who gets what item on the spot, raiders are tasked
    with assigning each item they want a value. This list of values (your Loot List) is used
    to calculate your priority for winning an item that drops.

<AboutQA Question="How do I get onto a raid team?">
    Create a loot list by going to your character page and submit your list to all raid teams you'd like to apply for.
    If a team has a spot for you, they will either accept your list and add you to the roster, or contact you about
    any issues with your list. Acceptance of a loot list is acceptance as a trial member to a raid team.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What can I put on my loot list?">
    For every phase of content, you may create a loot list containing gear that drops from the 25-man raids.
    For each spec of every class, items are categorized as either <span class="mud-success-text">Allowed</span>,
    <span class="mud-warning-text">Review</span>, or <span class="mud-error-text">Restricted</span>. While you may list
    any equippable item on your loot list, restricted items are very likely to be rejected by the raid leader.
    Review items may or may not be accepted depending on the raid leader's discretion. Be prepared to justify any
    non-allowed items on your list.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What are loot brackets?">
    Loot Lists are divided into brackets to force loot to be spread out throughout the list and thus help ensure
    items are distributed fairly amongst the raid. There are four brackets total and each bracket has a set of rules
    dictating what items may be in them:
    <ul class="default">
        <li>Brackets 1-3: restricted, only allows main-spec items and one item of a category per bracket.</li>
        <li>Bracket 4: unrestricted, allows any-spec items and multiple items of a category.</li>
    </ul>
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What are item categories?">
    Item categories for restricted brackets prevent multiple items of the same type in the same bracket. An example
    of this would be trying to put two chest armors in a single restricted bracket which is not allowed.
    The item categories are:
    <ul class="default">
        <li>Head Armor</li>
        <li>Shoulder Armor</li>
        <li>Chest Armor</li>
        <li>Waist Armor</li>
        <li>Leg Armor</li>
        <li>Foot Armor</li>
        <li>Wrist Armor</li>
        <li>Hand Armor</li>
        <li>Rings & Necklaces</li>
        <li>Trinkets</li>
        <li>Cloaks</li>
        <li>Weapons, Shields & Offhands</li>
        <li>Wands & Relics</li>
    </ul>
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can I put off-spec items on my loot list?">
    Yes. When you make your list you may specify an off-spec. Items that fit your off-spec are allowed in the
    last bracket of your loot list. Pure damage classes do not really have off-specs but you are still required
    to set your main-spec for raid recruiting purposes.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can I put recipes, legendaries, or other non-gear items on my loot list?">
    No. Recipes are handled by the discretion of the raid leaders. Legendaries
    (<ItemLink Id="46017" PlaceholderText="Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings" Colorize Bracketize LinkEnabled /> and
    <ItemLink Id="49623" PlaceholderText="Shadowmourne" Colorize Bracketize LinkEnabled />)
    are distributed via loot council by the raid leadership to dedicated and top performing players.
    Mounts that drop in raid are distributed with a random roll with a guild-wide +1 for all other raid mounts.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can other players see my loot list?">
    Yes, although your exact loot list rankings will be hidden until your list is approved and locked. You can share your
    loot list with others if you wish but it is not recommended to prevent loot-gaming unless requesting help from others.
    The raid leaders will always be able to see your exact rankings.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="How do I win an item?">
    The person with the highest priority when an item drops wins it. Priority is calculated by taking the rank
    you gave an item and adding up all of the various bonuses you've acquired to it. The possible bonuses are:

                <td>
                    Each month you may donate to the guild's bank character for a bonus the next month. The specific items
                    or gold amount that is required for a bonus will be announced each month in Discord. Your bonus can be
                    +1, +2, or +3 depending on how much is donated. This bonus is not permanent and will reset to +0 on the first
                    of the month if no donations were made. Donations do not roll-over if you donate more than what's required
                    for a full +3 bonus.

                <td>
                    +2 to all item priorities if the player's gear is gemmed and enchanted to the raid leaders' satisfaction.
                    This bonus does not accumulate and will never go higher than +2. Ask your raid leader about their criteria for gaining this bonus.
                </td>

                <td>
                    +1 to all item priorities if the player is prepared ahead of time for the specific requirements of the raid. Ask your
                    raid leader about the specific requirements for gaining or losing this bonus.

                <td>
                    +1 to a specific item's priority each time the player is present when an item drops.
                    This is bad-luck protection regarding the specific item but also allows players to pass items down the raid's priority list
                    without giving up their own priority on the item the next time it drops.

                    -24 priority penalty on all items for trial members the first week of raiding. Penalty reduced to -12 the second week of

                    Each absence during a phase will give you a penalty following this order: -0, -1, -1, -2, -3, -5, -8, -13, -21, -34
                    <br />
                    You'll be considered absent if you aren't at raid within 5 minutes of the raid start time.
                    If you post in your team's absence channel in discord (25-mans) or contact your raid leader (10-mans) prior to the raid start time,
                    you'll be allowed up to 15 minutes past raid start to show up without being marked absent.
                    <br />
                    This penalty resets at the start of a new phase.

</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What happens if someone has the same priority as me?">
    If there's a tie for highest priority, then it goes to a <code>/roll</code> between those players. The highest
    roll gets the item and everyone else gets their loss bonus.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Do I have to take an item if I have highest priority?">
    No. Players may choose to pass to the next highest person or forego a tiebreaker roll, though there is no
    personal benefit to doing this. You still gain your loss bonus as normal.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What happens if an item drops and nobody has it on their list?">
    Any item with no loot list competition goes to an open <code>/roll</code> that anyone, even non-members, may roll for.
    The only restriction to this roll is the item must be equipped by the winner.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="I won an item but I sold/destroyed/disenchanted it! Can I win it again?">
    No. All wins are recorded and will prevent you from competing for it again. You may win a second copy of an item
    only if it goes to an open roll.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can I change my loot list?">
    The only time you can change your loot list is if you are not on a raid team, have no pending raid team applications,
    or have not raided yet and your loot list is not locked.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What if I want to change my main-spec?">
    Changing your main-spec is at the discretion of your raid leader. If you do decide to change specs, you will
    get the opportunity to edit your list to fit your new spec. Any items won by your old list cannot be changed.
    That is, if you ranked a DPS item at rank 18 and won it, you may not fill that rank 18 slot with a new tank item.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What if I want to change my main character?">
    Changing your main character in the raid is at the discretion of your raid leader. You will have to make a new loot list
    if you do decide to change mains but you will not be allowed to fill out item ranks that your previous character had already won.
    All of your prior bonuses (except for loss & pass bonuses) will transfer to the new main.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="What happens when new raids are released?">
    Your loot list you made for each phase stays with you indefinitely. When a new raid tier releases, you will need
    to submit a new list for that tier. Your old list will still be used if and when your raid team runs older
    raids.
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can I change raid teams?">
    Changing teams is possible but comes with some penalties and is not a guarantee that you will be on a team.
    If accepted, you will join that team as a trial member and lose any bonuses you've gained from running with your
    previous team. Be sure that the team you first apply for works for you in the long-run!
</AboutQA>

<AboutQA Question="Can I raid even if I don't have a loot list made?">
    Yes. You won't have priority on winning loot over anyone with a loot list, but if an item goes to open roll you are
    allowed to roll for it. Any items you do win will not be available for selection when you do make your loot list.
